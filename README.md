# SciSPY
A powerful AI framework for scientific computing and automated task management, built on the Heurist AI principles.

## Overview

SciSpy is an open-source framework that combines hierarchical task management with multi-agent systems to solve complex scientific computing problems. It provides researchers and developers with tools for automated data analysis, decision support, and process management.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Task Management**
  - Smart task decomposition
  - Dependency tracking
  - Dynamic resource allocation

- **Multi-Agent System**
  - Specialized agents for different domains
  - Robust inter-agent communication
  - Centralized coordination

- **Advanced Knowledge Processing**
  - Structured knowledge representation
  - Machine learning integration 
  - Cross-domain knowledge transfer

- **Resource Optimization**
  - Automated resource allocation
  - Memory management
  - Load balancing

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy ≥ 1.20
- TensorFlow ≥ 2.6
- 8GB RAM minimum
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)

## Quick Start

```python
from scispy import TaskManager, Agent

# Initialize task manager
tm = TaskManager()

# Create specialized agent
agent = Agent(domain="data_analysis")

# Define and execute task
task = tm.create_task("analyze_dataset")
result = agent.execute(task)
```
